# Fixes Applied - Animation and FPS Issues

## Issue 1: Filter Sliders Affecting Animation Movement ✓ FIXED

### Problem
When adjusting filter sliders (brightness, contrast, etc.), the animation would restart and objects would move around. This was because the style injection was triggering a full animation restart every time filters changed.

### Solution
Modified the preview update mechanism to dynamically update styles without restarting animations:

1. **Updated `injectStyleIntoCode` function** (`utils.ts`):
   - Added `includeAnimationRestart` parameter (default: `false`)
   - Added `updateFilterStyles` window function for dynamic style updates
   - This allows styles to be changed without reloading the iframe or restarting animations

2. **Updated preview rendering logic** (`App.tsx`):
   - Animation restart only occurs on initial load or when code changes
   - Filter adjustments now use the dynamic `updateFilterStyles` function
   - Prevents iframe reload and animation restart when only filters change

### Result
✓ Filter sliders now only affect visual effects (brightness, contrast, saturation, etc.)
✓ Animations continue smoothly without restarting or jumping
✓ Objects stay in their proper positions during filter adjustments

## Issue 2: Generated MP4 Has Lower FPS Than Preview ✓ FIXED

### Problem
The generated MP4 video had significantly lower FPS (~20 FPS) than the configured FPS (24 FPS). This was caused by a hardcoded 50ms delay between frame captures.

### Solution
Changed the frame capture timing to use the actual FPS setting:

**Before:**
```javascript
timerRef.current = window.setTimeout(captureFrame, 50); // Always 50ms = ~20 FPS
```

**After:**
```javascript
const frameInterval = 1000 / fps; // Calculate correct interval (e.g., 1000/24 = ~41.67ms)
timerRef.current = window.setTimeout(captureFrame, frameInterval);
```

### Result
✓ MP4 videos now render at the correct FPS (24 FPS by default)
✓ Frame timing is accurate and matches the preview
✓ Smoother video output with proper frame pacing

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `/tools/code-to-mp4/src/utils.ts` - Enhanced style injection with dynamic updates
2. `/tools/code-to-mp4/src/App.tsx` - Fixed preview updates and FPS timing
   - Added TypeScript declaration for `updateFilterStyles`
   - Implemented smart preview update logic
   - Fixed frame capture interval calculation

### Testing Recommendations
1. Test filter sliders (brightness, contrast, saturation) - animations should stay smooth
2. Generate an MP4 and verify it plays at 24 FPS
3. Test different FPS settings to ensure correct timing
4. Verify VHS effect still works correctly with all overlays
5. Test code changes trigger proper animation restart

### Compatibility
✓ All existing functionality preserved
✓ No breaking changes to API or user interface
✓ Backward compatible with existing animations
